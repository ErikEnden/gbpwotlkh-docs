## Individual XP
You can set your xp rate by using the chat command .xp set <number>. Currently the cap is 10 but if people want I'll figure out how to change that. There's also some other options, .xp to show, fairly self explanatory.

## Playerbots
Documentation for the playerbots mod is here - https://github.com/liyunfan1223/mod-playerbots/wiki. The addon specified in the install process makes using them a lot smoother, it's pretty obtuse without. Since the controls are through chat commands you can also make macros to control them.
